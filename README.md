-Use "npm start" to start the WebApp go to the directory where the package.json resides.





Regarding the bonus question "Explain why the result of `('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase()` is `banana`"


-On the first string 'b' and second string 'a' it will be correctly displayed 


Ex.) "ba"


then regarding on the two plus sign together '+ +' the first addition operator will act as a concatination for "ba" 


then the second operator will be to convert a string into a number which is the next string 'a' 


Ex.) +'a' this will make the string 'a' into a number but the string 'a' doesn't represent a number therefore it will convert it into numbered value which is "NaN" also called as Not A Number


then on the last string 'a' will be concatinated properly


*This is how it looks*


"baNaNa"


then use toLowerCase() the final look will be:


"banana"
